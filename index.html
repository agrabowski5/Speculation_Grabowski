			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
				<ol>
				<li>
					<strong>How do the demographic characteristics (race, income, etc.) of neighborhoods with higher rates of corporate and absentee ownership compare to neighborhoods with lower rates?</strong>
					<ul>
					<li>Motivation: This question was motivated by the interest in understanding which demographics these corporate and absentee owners are targeting for 
						investment. From discussions with friends, I'd expect that corporate investment would be expanding out from typical affluent neighborhoods.
						This interest comes from trying to understand the strategy of gentrification of neighborhoods. <em>Source: When Private Equity Becomes Your Landlord</em></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>How has the proportion of investors utilizing flips changed over time in the Metro Boston region?</strong>
					<ul>
					<li>Motivation: This question was motivated to see how big this problem has become through time. The goal was to confirm that this is actually something that is occurring and not just a result of being more aware of housing market questions as one gets older. <em>Source: Discussion with Friends who work in Real Estate</em></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>What is the relationship between the increase in housing production of New and Expensive residential buildings and the rise
						in corporate ownership in Boston's newest and most expensive high-rises?</strong>
					<ul>
					<li>Motivation: This question is motivated by an interest to confirm whether the wealthy are building these high-end houses for actual 
						living or if it's an investment mechanism. <em>Source: Spotlight Boston Towers of Wealth</em></li>

					<strong> Boston Corporate Ownership Data Exploration</strong> The initial exploration of the dataset commenced by overlaying several 
					key variables onto the geographic framework of Boston to analyze 
					spatial distributions and identify areas of missing data. 
					The first visualization focused on the "Corporate Ownership Rates" dataset, 
					specifically examining the "Corp_own_rate" field, thereby providing a preliminary understanding of the dataset's geographic characteristics.
					These results are validated by my personal experience of living in Boston over the past 7 years, and seeing the growth and development of the city.
					A Boston Shapefile obtained from Zillow facilitated the development of an interactive map, while the dataset integration of neighborhood names with ZIP 
					codes enabled the delineation of neighborhood boundaries. This approach revealed notable spatial limitations within the dataset; for 
					instance, areas such as Mission Hill, Longwood Medical Area, and the Harbor Islands lacked information on corporate ownership rates. 
					Overall, this analysis serves as an effective introduction to the spatial dimensions and limitations of the dataset.

				  <figcaption>
					<strong> Boston Ethnicity/Race Demographic Data Exploration</strong> This visualization follows the previous graphic to create an interactive 
					exploration of Boston's demographic composition, providing insights into the spatial distribution of population data. 
					Specifically, it enables an investigation of the demographics, specifically race and 
					ethnicity across various neighborhoods. Interactive tooltips offer a detailed breakdown of the proportional representation for each demographic group,
					 thereby enhancing the granularity of the analysis. Preliminary observations from the visualization indicate that non-white populations are predominantly
					  concentrated in the southern and eastern sectors of the city, notably within neighborhoods such as Roxbury and Mattapan. 
					  This visualization aids in the understanding the limitations and data quality around ethnicity and race data. This visualization aims to give the viewer
					  an understanding of the demographics of the city leading into Question 1/.

				<h2><strong>Question 1 Exploration Phase: How do the demographic characteristics (race, income, etc.) of neighborhoods with higher rates of 
					corporate and absentee ownership compare to neighborhoods with lower rates?</strong></h2>
			
					<figure>
				<img src="Corporate_Ownership_Rates_with_Average.png" class="responsive-image" alt="Corporate Ownership Rates with Average" />
				<figcaption>
					<strong> Boston Corporate Ownernship rates versus Owner Occupancy Rate from 2004-2024</strong> This visualization provides a clear look at 
					how corporate ownership rates have shifted from 2004 to 2024, and it compares those changes 
					with owner occupancy rates across various demographics. Notably, as corporate ownership has increased across neighborhoods, owner occupancy
					 rates have tended to decline, suggesting that more homes are remaining unoccupied. This trend might imply that properties are increasingly
					  being used as investment vehicles rather than primary residences—a pattern also highlighted in the Boston Globe. This visualization operates on a 
					  neighborhood-level granularity, however it requires further analysis to understand how this data relates to demographic information.

					<strong> Boston Neighborhood Demographic Breakdown relationship to Corporate Ownership and Owner Occupancy in 2024</strong>
					This graphic explores the relationship between corporate ownership and absentee ownership across different racial and ethnic groups. 
					The X axis is arranged according to the proportion of non-white residents in each neighborhood, focusing specifically on data from 2024.
					 The visualization clearly shows a negative correlation between corporate ownership rates and absentee rates—a trend that persists in other years as 
					 well. By examining these patterns, the graphic aims to shed light on how demographics influence corporate ownership practices.

					<strong> Regression of Corporate Investment and Neighborhood Demographics</strong> 
					As a follow-up to the previous graphic, this visualization aims to determine whether corporate investment demonstrates 
					any neighborhood-specific preferences 
					linked to ethnicity or racial composition. In this plot, a regression analysis was applied to data spanning multiple years and neighborhoods.
					 The results reveal an increase in corporate investment in neighborhoods predominantly composed of AAPI and White residents with the positively sloped line. 
					 This graphic not only shows the geographic distribution of corporate investment but also deepens our understanding of how demographic 
					 factors can steer investment patterns—a trend consistent with the Boston Globe's analysis of luxury condo markets.

				<h2><strong>Question 2 Exploration Phase: How has the proportion of residential property sales to investors (i.e. "flips") changed over time in the Metro Boston region?</strong></h2>
			
			<figure>
				<img src="Boston_Flips_vs_NonFlips.png"  alt="" class="responsive-image"/>
				<figcaption>
					<strong> Proportion of Flips versus Long Term Purchases in Boston through the Years</strong> 
					This plot illustrates the trends in the number of property flips and non-flips per year from 2000 to 2022. 
					Notably, there was a significant spike in flips in the early 2010s that continued until 2019, which then hit a small downturn.
					This shows variations similar to any financial instrument market which is also discussed in the "When Private Equity becomes your landlord" article.
					As the years progress, the fluctuations in flips and non-flips suggest changing economic conditions or shifts in investor behavior, 
					which correlate with broader housing market trends such as housing bubble effects or post-recession recovery. The proposed bill to develop a
					 local transfer fee could help reduce the incentive to flip houses, enabling a more stable housing market.

					<strong> Distribution of Flipping Markets throughout Boston</strong> 
					This visualization is a heatmap that illustrates the distribution of property flips across Boston. 
					When zoomed in,  these flips can be seen to be concentrated in specific clusters, revealing a strong centralization in 
					certain neighborhoods. Additionally, the map underscores the limited geographical scope of the dataset—highlighting that many outliers 
					were removed in order to focus the analysis on a more manageable area.

				<h2><strong>Question 3 Exploration Phase: What is the relationship between the increase in housing production of New and Expensive residential buildings and the rise
					 in corporate ownership in Boston's newest and most expensive high-rises?</strong></h2>
			<figure>
				<img src="boston_trends_heatmap.png" alt="" class="responsive-image"/>
				<figcaption>
					<strong> Heatmap of New and Expensive housing correlating with Absentee Owners</strong> 
					This heatmap offers a clear glimpse into Boston's real estate trends from 2000 to 2022, focusing on three key metrics: 
					New Expensive Production, Absentee Sales, and their Intersection. The goal was to explore topics related to the Boston Globe's claim that developers 
					built approximately five times more luxury condos for the ultra-affluent than affordable units for lower-income households in recent years.

					To analyze these trends, categorizations were established where a property is classified as "expensive" if it sits within the top 50% of sale prices, 
					and considered "new" if the development occurred in 2000 or later. Data from New Expensive Production illustrates a marked surge in luxury condo 
					developments post-2000, while trends in Corporate ownership Sales point to a substantial presence of non-resident investors. The Intersection metric further 
					highlights the overlap between expensive developments and absentee ownership, underscoring concentrated market investment. The persistant increase in 
					these metrics shows the growing trend of luxury housing development and corporate ownership in Boston.
					
					Overall, the graphic reveals a shift in development priorities that strongly favors upscale projects, thereby reinforcing the observation regarding 
					the disparity between luxury and affordable housing initiatives in Boston. This increaseed New and Expensive developments, while also increasing the  
					number of corporate sales of the buildings.
					
					This brings up a question of the most expensive residential properties in Boston, who is buying them. Are they corporations or individuals?

					<strong> Most Expensive Residential Properties in Boston and whether a corporation or individual purchased them</strong>
					A follow up question to the "Heatmap of New and Expensive housing correlating with Absentee Owners" visaulization was how many expensive 
					residential purchases are made by corporates entities versus individuals. The Homes for Profit article  states that 1 in 5 residential purchases 
					were made by investors. In these most expensive houses of Boston, 38.21% of residences were purchased by corporations. 
					 This visualization was to show the scale of the 
					investments being made in the Boston area regarding residential purchases and where these purchases are coming from. 
					As Discussed in the "When Private Equity becomes your Landlord" article, it can be seen that it's 
					about split between Corporate ownership and individual ownership of these properties. This graphic aims to be a more pictorial representation
					to show how involved corporations are in the involvement of the Boston housing market.
					This data was filtered down by property type, and ordered by sale price. Sale Price was purposedfully not prioritized for viewing.

					<strong> Bottom Quartile Highest Prices Properties in Boston and whether a corporation or individual purchased them</strong>
					A follow up to the "Most Expensive Residential Properties in Boston and whether a corporation or individual purchased them" visualization 
					was to see if the trend of corporate ownership of residential properties was consistent across all price ranges. This visualization shows 
					the bottom quartile	of properties in Boston and whether they were purchased by corporations or individuals. 
					This visualization shows that the trend of corporate ownership of expensive properties is inconsistent across price ranges with 
					corporate ownership at 2% in this bottom quartile. Although, this is expected, it is interesting to observe graphically. 
					This data was filtered down by property type, and ordered by sale price. Sale Price was purposedfully not prioritized for viewing. House Image credited to Microsoft.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>Using spatial mapping, regression analysis, and integrated datasets, the research explores how corporate investments shape communities. 
				It compares demographics in neighborhoods with high versus low corporate and absentee ownership, tracks changes in property flips over time, 
				and examines the link between upscale new housing developments and corporate buying. These analyses reveal that speculative investments
				 often target areas ripe for gentrification, demonstrate evolving investor behavior, and highlight an overlap between luxury developments
				  and non-resident buyers.

				From the plot it is easy to discern that much more corporate investment is being made in white and wealthy neighborhoods, while whether it is 
				through a flipping mechanism or just as a longer term hold investment. This is a trend that is consistent with the Boston Globe's analysis of
				luxury real estate purchases. This continuous development and speculation of luxury housing will continue displace low and middle income housing
				continueing to make Boston have unaffordable housing. The use of residential properties as investment vehicles rather than homes is a trend that
				is likely to continue make housing unaffordable for the average Bostonian.

			<h2>Data Used, Limitations and Key Transformations</h2>
				<li>The primary data limitations arose from the varying geographic scopes of each dataset. For instance, 
					the Corporate Ownership and Occupancy dataset did not cover all Boston neighborhoods, while the EDA dataset was
					 even more geographically restricted.

					In addition, although the U.S. Census collects data every ten years, the census data spanning from 2004 to 2024 largely 
					remained unchanged across my fields, which reduced the overall fidelity of my analysis.
					
					A key transformation applied to the data was merging tables by neighborhood instead of relying solely on Zip Codes, 
					which was recently highlighted by NPR's Planet Money in their "ZIP Codes!"
					 episode. Further transformations involved standardizing geographic classifications to align neighborhoods with logical regions 
					 on our Folium maps created in Python. Finally, regression analyses were performed to better understand the relationship between 
					 demographic factors and corporate ownership rates.
